            Singampuli was born and brought up in Theni, Periyakulam and after studying engineering in Bangalore, he arrived in Chennai looking for a career in films. During his stint as an assistant director with Sundar C, Singampuli suggested the original plot point of Unnaithedi to the director and Sundar wrote the script of the film within a week, before discussing the line with actor Ajith Kumar. Ajith was initially unimpressed but agreed to do the romantic story anyway, mentioning that if the film became a success he would feature in a future film to be directed by Singampuli.[2] Subsequently, he agreed terms to work in the 2002 action film Red, a story telling the tale of a Madurai-based revolutionary. The film opened to mixed reviews upon release and eventually the film had an average run at the box office but went on to gain cult status among ajith fans after some years.[3] In 2005, he made the kidnap comedy film Maayavi featuring Suriya and Jyothika, winning acclaim for his work.[4]

            Director Bala cast him in an acting role as a beggar in Naan Kadavul (2009) and since Singampuli has appeared in several films in supporting roles. His recent appearance in the Mysskin's directorial 'Psycho' earned a very good reputation in the filmy community. [5]
